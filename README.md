# Dictionary Practice in Objective-C

## Goals
Dictionaries are a fundamental class in software development, and it's important to be comfortable with them. In this lab you're going to practice creating, writing to, accessing, and mutating dictionaries in Objective-C. You'll also get additional experience working with nested dictionaries, creating dummy data, and using logs to see the contents of your variables.

## Review
Let's go over what an **`NSDictionary`** is and how it's structured. 

Like an `NSArray`, an `NSDictionary` represents a collection of objects, which are referred to as *values*. You can store objects of any class inside, and those objects can even be `NSArray`s or other NSDictionaries.

Unlike an `NSArray`, which keeps track of the order of the objects it contains using an index, *the objects contained in an `NSDictionary` are unordered*. Since an unordered jumble of objects by itself isn't very useful, an `NSDictionary` requires that each of its values have a unique *key*.

> Think of the following stack of cats as an `NSArray`. The cats are stacked in a particular order, from the bottom up, and if you add or remove a cat at a particular location in the stack, the rest of the stack stays in the same order. Taking a cat (and its shelf) from anywhere but the top end of the stack would cause the rest of the cats to shift down and fill the empty space.

> These dogs, however, are much more like an `NSDictionary`. The puppies, like values, may jump all over one another and have no particular order. However, each puppy can be retrieved using its specific leash, or key, since no two dogs share a leash.

## Instructions
### Create some dummy data
Let's get started by opening up the provided Xcode project and creating data to work with. Instantiate an empty `NSDictionary` called `favoriteBands` in the AppDelegate.m file, where all your code will go. Add an `NSLog` to print out the contents of your new `NSDictionary`, as well as your own description of what's being printed, to the console when you hit âŒ˜ + R. It should look something like this:

```objc
Here's the empty favoriteBands dictionary: 
{

}
```

Great! We've got a place to store your favorite bands. But wait, we can't write to this dictionary as it is...

### Create a mutable dictionary
Since we can't write to an `NSDictionary`, we're going to have to create a version we can edit. Go ahead and make an `NSMutableDictionary` from our original `favoriteBands` using the `dictionaryWithDictionary:` method.

> The reason `dictionaryWithDictionary:` is preferable to `mutableCopy` is that we can be certain a new dictionary will be created. If the original object from which we try to create a `mutableCopy` is `nil`, we'll get back `nil`, not a new object.

Now that we've got a dictionary we can edit, let's add in your favorite bands and their albums.

### Add key-value pairs to the mutable dictionary
Think of three of your favorite bands or musical artists, then find the titles of your favorite album by each band/artist. With your three artists and three albums, you now have enough information to add key-value pairs into the `favoriteBands` dicionary.

Let's add the first artist-album pair by calling the `setObject:forKey:` method on `favoriteBands`. For the next pair, use the literal syntax and diectly set the value for the key. This line of code should look something like `favoriteBands[@"FAVORITE BAND"] = @"FAVORITE ALBUM"`. Here we're telling the dictionary that the key `FAVORITE BAND` should have the value `FAVORITE ALBUM`.

Choose one of the two methods you just implemented to add your third artist-album pair to `favoriteBands`. Now write an `NSLog` to show the contents of the dictionary now that we've added our favorite bands and albums. The results should be similar to this:

```objc
Favorite bands and albums:
{
	"Queens of the Stone Age" = "Songs for the Deaf",
	"Death from Above 1979" = "Physical World",
	"Spoon" = "They Want My Soul"
}
```

### Change the contents of the mutable dictionary
`removeObjectForKey:`

### Enumerate a dictionary
> Warning: Dictionaries should not be altered while iterating over them.

By using a `for in` loop we can iterate over the keys of an NSDictionary

### Accessing keys from a dictionary
`allKeys`
`keysContaingObject:`

### Create dictionaries with different syntaxes
* Literal syntax
* Values and keys as arguments
* Values and keys as arrays

### Nested dictionaries
`dictionary[@"keyInTopDictionary][@"keyInNestedDictionary"]`

### Combine contents of dictionaries
`addEntriesFromDictionary:`

>
### Primitive types vs. Reference types
All objects in Objective-C are of either Primitive type or Reference type. Reference types are any instantiable class, including Dictionaries and more complex objects, meaning you must create/initialize an instance of the class for it to exist. When you visit the memory location of a Primitive type object, you will see the value of the object. When you visit the memory location of a Reference type object, you will find pointers to other memory locations where the values of the variables inside the object reside.
